ADD HTTP COMMUNICATION TO YOUR APP
THEORY/SUMMARY:
Summary: In this lesson, you updated your app to use a local web server (json-server),
and use asynchronous service methods to retrieve data.

This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate HTTP and an API into your app.
Up until this point your app has read data from a static array in an Angular service.
The next step is to use a JSON server that your app will communicate with over HTTP.
The HTTP request will simulate the experience of working with data from a server.
IMPORTANT: We recommend using your local environment for this step of the tutorial.
What you'll learn:
-Your app will use data from a JSON server
-Configure the JSON server
JSON Server is an open source tool used to create mock REST APIs.
You'll use it to serve the housing location data that is currently stored in the housing service.

PRACTICE:
1. Install json-server from npm by using the following command.
A. npm install -g json-server
2. In the root directory of your project, create a file called db.json.
A. This is where you will store the data for the json-server.
3. Open db.json and copy the following code into the file

A. Save this file.
4. Time to test your configuration.
A. From the command line, at the root of your project run the following commands.
B. json-server --watch db.json
5. In your web browser, navigate to the http://localhost:3000/locations and confirm that the response includes the data stored in db.json.
A. If you have any trouble with your configuration, you can find more details in the official documentation.
6. Update service to use web server instead of local array
A. The data source has been configured, the next step is to update your web app to connect to it use the data.
B. In src/app/housing.service.ts, make the following changes:
C. Update the code to remove housingLocationList property and the array containing the data.
D. Add a string property called url and set its value to 'http://localhost:3000/locations'
E. url = 'http://localhost:3000/locations';
F. This code will result in errors in the rest of the file because it depends on the housingLocationList property.
6. We're going to update the service methods next.
A. Update the getAllHousingLocations function to make a call to the web server you configured.
B. adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/14-http/src-final/app/housing.service.ts
async getAllHousingLocations(): Promise<HousingLocation[]> {
    const data = await fetch(this.url);
    return (await data.json()) ?? [];
}
C. The code now uses asynchronous code to make a GET request over HTTP.
D. HELPFUL: For this example, the code uses fetch.
E. For more advanced use cases consider using HttpClient provided by Angular.
7. Update the getHousingLocationsById function to make a call to the web server you configured.
A. adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/14-http/src-final/app/housing.service.ts
async getHousingLocationById(id: number): Promise<HousingLocation | undefined> {
    const data = await fetch(`${this.url}/${id}`);
    return (await data.json()) ?? {};
}
8. Once all the updates are complete, your updated service should match the following code.
9. Final version of housing.service.ts
10. Update the components to use asynchronous calls to the housing service
A. The server is now reading data from the HTTP request but the components that rely on the service now have errors
B. ... because they were programmed to use the synchronous version of the service.
C. In src/app/home/home.component.ts, update the constructor to use the new asynchronous version of the getAllHousingLocations method.
D. adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/14-http/src-final/app/home/home.component.ts
constructor() {
    this.housingService.getAllHousingLocations().then((housingLocationList: HousingLocation[]) => {
        this.housingLocationList = housingLocationList;
        this.filteredLocationList = housingLocationList;
    });
}
11. In src/app/details/details.component.ts, update the constructor to use the new 
A. ... asynchronous version of the getHousingLocationById method.
B. adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/14-http/src-final/app/details/details.component.ts
constructor() {
    const housingLocationId = parseInt(this.route.snapshot.params['id'], 10);
    this.housingService.getHousingLocationById(housingLocationId).then((housingLocation) => {
        this.housingLocation = housingLocation;
});
}
12. Save your code.
13. Open the application in the browser and confirm that it runs without any errors.
14. Note: This lesson relies on the fetch browser API.
A. For the support of interceptors, please refer to the Http Client documentation
15. Congratulations! You've successfully completed this tutorial and are ready to continue your journey
A. ... with building even more complex Angular Apps.
16. If you would like to learn more, please consider completing some of Angular's other developer tutorials and guides.
