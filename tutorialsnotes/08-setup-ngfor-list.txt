USE *NGFOR TO LIST OBJECTS IN COMPONENT
THEORY/SUMMARY:
Summary: In this lesson, you used the ngFor directive to repeat data dynamically in Angular templates.
You also added a new array of data to be used in the Angular app.
The application now dynamically renders a list of housing locations in the browser.
This tutorial lesson demonstrates how to use ngFor directive in Angular templates
in order to display dynamically repeated data in a template.

What you'll learn
-You will have added a data set to the app
-Your app will display a list of elements from the new data set using ngFor

CONCEPTUAL PREVIEW OF NGFOR
In Angular, ngFor is a specific type of directive used to dynamically repeat data in a template.
In plain JavaScript you would use a for loop - ngFor provides similar functionality for Angular templates.
You can utilize ngFor to iterate over arrays and even asynchronous values.
In this lesson, you'll add a new array of data to iterate over.
For a more in depth explanation, please refer to the Built-in directives guide.

PRACTICE:
ADD HOUSING DATA TO THE HOMECOMPONENT
1. In the HomeComponent there is only a single housing location.
2. In this step, you will add an array of HousingLocation entries.
A. In src/app/home/home.component.ts, remove the housingLocation property from the HomeComponent class.
B. Update the HomeComponent class to have a property called housingLocationList.
C. Update your code to match the following code: Add housingLocationList property
D. IMPORTANT: Do not remove the @Component decorator, you will update that code in an upcoming step.
UPDATE THE HOMECOMPONENT TEMPLATE TO USE NGFOR
2. Now the app has a dataset that you can use to display the entries in the browser using the ngFor directive.
A. Update the <app-housing-location> tag in the template code to this: Add ngFor to HomeComponent template
<section class="results">
<app-housing-location
    *ngFor="let housingLocation of housingLocationList"
    [housingLocation]="housingLocation"
></app-housing-location>
</section>
B. NOTE: in the code [housingLocation] = "housingLocation"
C. the housingLocation value now refers to the variable used in the ngFor directive.
D. Before this change, it referred to the property on the HomeComponent class.
3. Save all changes.
4. Refresh the browser and confirm that the app now renders a grid of housing locations.

5. The app is taking shape, great job.
