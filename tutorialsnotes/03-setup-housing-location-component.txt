CREATE THE APPLICATION'S HOUSINGLOCATION COMPONENT
NOTE: REMEMBER TO ADD standalone: true TO THE @Component PORTION TO AVOID AN IMPORT ERROR

THEORY/SUMMARY:
Summary: In this lesson, you created a new component for your app and added it to the app's layout.
This tutorial lesson demonstrates how to add the HousingLocation component to your Angular app.
What you'll learn:
Your app has a new component: HousingLocationComponent and it displays a message confirming that the component was added to your application.

PRACTICE:
1. Create the HousingLocationComponent: In this step, you create a new component for your app.
A. In the Terminal pane of your IDE: In your project directory, navigate to the [first-app]/root directory.
B. Run this command to create a new HousingLocationComponent: ng generate component housingLocation [--skip-import]
C. Run this command to build and serve your app: ng serve
I. Note: This step is only for your local environment!
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to find the application.
A. Confirm that the app builds without error.
B. HELPFUL: It should render the same as it did in the previous lesson ...
C. ... because even though you added a new component, you haven't included it in any of the app's templates, yet.
3. Leave ng serve running as you complete the next steps.

ADD THE NEW COMPONENT TO YOUR APP'S LAYOUT
4. In this step, you add the new component, HousingLocationComponent ...
5. ... to your app's HomeComponent, so that it displays in your app's layout.
6. In the Edit pane of your IDE: Open home.component.ts in the editor.
A. In home.component.ts, import HousingLocationComponent by adding this line to the file level imports.
B. (Import HousingLocationComponent in src/app/home/home.component.ts)
C. import {HousingLocationComponent} from '../housing-location/housing-location.component';
7. Next update the imports property of the @Component metadata by adding HousingLocationComponent to the array.
A. (Add HousingLocationComponent to imports array in src/app/home/home.component.ts)
B. imports: [CommonModule, HousingLocationComponent], (also remember standalone: true)
8. Now the component is ready for use in the template for the HomeComponent.
A. Update the template property of the @Component metadata to include a reference to the <app-housing-location> tag.
9. Add housing location to the component template in src/app/home/home.component.ts
template: `
<section>
<form>
<input type="text" placeholder="Filter by city" />
<button class="primary" type="button">Search</button>
</form>
</section>
<section class="results">
<app-housing-location></app-housing-location>
</section>
`,
10. Add the styles for the component
A. In this step, you will copy over the pre-written styles for the HousingLocationComponent
B. ... to your app so that the app renders properly.
C. Open src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.css, and paste the styles below into the file:
D. NOTE: In the browser, these can go in src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.ts in the styles array.
E. Add CSS styles to housing location to the component in src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.css:
.listing {background: var(--accent-color);  border-radius: 30px;  padding-bottom: 30px;}
.listing-heading {color: var(--primary-color);  padding: 10px 20px 0 20px;}
.listing-photo {height: 250px;  width: 100%;  object-fit: cover;  border-radius: 30px 30px 0 0;}
.listing-location {padding: 10px 20px 20px 20px;}
.listing-location::before {content: url("/assets/location-pin.svg") / "";}
section.listing a {padding-left: 20px;  text-decoration: none;  color: var(--primary-color);}
section.listing a::after {content: "\203A";  margin-left: 5px;}
11. Save your code, return to the browser and confirm that the app builds without error.
A. You should find the message "housing-location works!" rendered to the screen.
B. Correct any errors before you continue to the next step.
